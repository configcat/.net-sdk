# ConfigCat SDK for .NET

ConfigCat SDK for .NET provides easy integration between ConfigCat service and applications using .NET.

ConfigCat is a feature flag, feature toggle, and configuration management service. That lets you launch new features and change your software configuration remotely without actually (re)deploying code. ConfigCat even helps you do controlled roll-outs like canary releases and blue-green deployments.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install the [package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ConfigCat.Client) with [NuGet](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console) 
```PowerShell
Install-Package ConfigCat.Client
```

### 2. Import *ConfigCat.Client* to your application
```c#
using ConfigCat.Client;
```

### 3. <a href="https://configcat.com/Account/Login" target="_blank">Log in to ConfigCat Management Console</a> and go to your *Project* to get your *API Key*
![ApiKey](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ConfigCat/.net-sdk/master/media/readme01.png  "ApiKey")

### 4. Create a **ConfigCat** client instance:
```c#
var client = new ConfigCatClient("#YOUR-API-KEY#");
```

> We strongly recommend using the *ConfigCat Client* as a Singleton object in your application.

### 5. Get your setting value:
```c#
var isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled = client.GetValue("isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled", false);

if(isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled)
{
    doTheNewThing();
}
else
{
    doTheOldThing();
}
```

### 6. On application exit:
``` c#
client.Dispose();
```
> To ensure graceful shutdown of the client you should invoke ```.Dispose()``` method. (Client implements [IDisposable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.idisposable(v=vs.110).aspx) interface)

## Getting user specific setting values with Targeting
Using this feature, you will be able to get different setting values for different users in your application by passing a `User Object` to the `GetValue()` function.

Read more about [Targeting here](https://docs.configcat.com/docs/advanced/targeting/).
```c#
User currentUser = new User("435170f4-8a8b-4b67-a723-505ac7cdea92");

var isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled = client.GetValue(
	"isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled",
	defaultValue: false,
	user: currentUser);
```

  * [Sample Web App](https://github.com/configcat/.net-sdk/tree/master/samples/ASP.NETCore)

## Polling Modes
The ConfigCat SDK supports 3 different polling mechanisms to acquire the setting values from ConfigCat. After latest setting values are downloaded, they are stored in the internal cache then all requests are served from there. Read more about Polling Modes and how to use them at [ConfigCat Docs](https://docs.configcat.com/docs/sdk-reference/csharp/).
