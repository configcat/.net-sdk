INFO [5000] Evaluating 'integer25One25Two25Three25FourAdvancedRules' for User '{"Identifier":"12345"}'
  Evaluating targeting rules and applying the first match if any:
  - IF User.Email CONTAINS ANY OF ['@configcat.com'] THEN '5' => cannot evaluate, the User.Email attribute is missing
    The current targeting rule is ignored and the evaluation continues with the next rule.
  Evaluating % options based on the User.Identifier attribute:
  - Computing hash in the [0..99] range from User.Identifier => 25 (this value is sticky and consistent across all SDKs)
  - Hash value 25 selects % option 2 (25%), '2'.
  Returning '2'.
